# GameEngineProject

A collection of game development projects and experiments using modern design patterns, state machines, and architecture across multiple game engines.

This repository is intended as a personal showcase and learning space for building modular, maintainable, and scalable game systems in **Unreal Engine 5**, **Unity**, and **Godot**.

## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

This repo is structured with dedicated folders for each engine, demonstrating core gameplay mechanics and reusable systems like:

- State Machines (AI, animation, gameplay)
- Modular architecture and component-based design
- Clean separation of logic (e.g., player, enemies, UI, game state)
- Reusable assets and patterns across engines
